Electric Eagle Drone Project
Project Overview
The Electric Eagle Drone Project is a collaborative effort led by a team of three dedicated individuals:

Alex Zaslvskis
Mike Zaslvskis
Danilo Zile
Our primary objective was to create a simple and flexible platform for developing Arduino-based drones. The project is an ongoing endeavor, and you can find detailed information on our official website.

Technologies and Tools Used
During the creation of this project, we utilized various technologies and tools to ensure its success:

YMFC-AL Version 1.4: Our flight control software.
Arduino IDE 1.8.10 and 1.0.6: The integrated development environment for programming the Arduino boards.
Sublime Text 3.22: A text editor for code development.
Python 3.7.6: Used for scripting and automation.
Java 11u06: Required for certain components.
Deviot: An Arduino IDE package manager.
Arduino Nano v3 (CH340): The microcontroller used in our project.
Motors and ESC from DJI Phantom 1 (FC40): High-quality propulsion components.
DJI 450 Frame: The drone's frame for stability and durability.
2200mAh 11.1V Battery: Power source for the drone.
SMD Capacitors (1206): Components for electrical stability (2μF, 1μF, 0.1nF).
SMD Resistors (1206): Components for electronic control.
And your three brilliant minds: Our team's expertise and creativity.
