# Electric Eagle Drone Project
Project Overview  
The Electric Eagle Drone Project is a collaborative effort led by a team of three dedicated individuals:  
* Alex Zaslvskis
* Mike Zaslvskis
* Danilo Zile

# Objectives
Our primary objective was to create a simple and flexible platform for developing Arduino-based drones. The project is an ongoing endeavor, and you can find detailed information on our official website.

# Technologies and Tools Used
During the creation of this project, we utilized various technologies and tools to ensure its success:

1. YMFC-AL Version 1.4: Our flight control software.
2. Arduino IDE 1.8.10 and 1.0.6: The integrated development environment for programming the Arduino boards.
3. Sublime Text 3.22: A text editor for code development.
4. Python 3.7.6: Used for scripting and automation.
5. Java 11u06: Required for certain components.
6. Deviot: An Arduino IDE package manager.
7. Arduino Nano v3 (CH340): The microcontroller used in our project.
8. Motors and ESC from DJI Phantom 1 (FC40): High-quality propulsion components.
9. DJI 450 Frame: The drone's frame for stability and durability.
10. 2200mAh 11.1V Battery: Power source for the drone.
11. SMD Capacitors (1206): Components for electrical stability (2μF, 1μF, 0.1nF).
12. SMD Resistors (1206): Components for electronic control.
13. And your three brilliant minds: Our team's expertise and creativity.
